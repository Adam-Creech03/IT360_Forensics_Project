Before Running the Program make sure Python is installed - 
additionally the database for geoip2 needs to be installed and you need to point the code to the downloaded file (line:13, log_parser.py)

1. Download the Script 
   Save the Python script (`log_parser.py`) to a directory where you want to keep it.  

2. Prepare the Log File
   Place your `access.log` file in the same directory as the script.

3. Open the Command Prompt  
   Open a command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the directory containing your files.  
   Example:  
   cd /users/auser/project

4. Run the Script

   Type : Python3 log_parser.py

5. Loading a File
   The Project is now running. 
   Set your flags with the GUI first.
   Use the GUI to upload a web server access log file.

6. Review the Results
   The script will display suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts.
